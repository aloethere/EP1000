# Split Flap Counter
Summary project for the Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals module

I plan to create a Youtube Subcriber Counter using the split flap mechanism controlled by a servo motor using arduino. The counter will use a split flap mechanism and was inspired by counters like [Smiirl](https://www.smiirl.com/en/store?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvvTDg8Ls6gIVlH0rCh0ipgDZEAAYASAAEgKEMfD_BwE) and [FlapIt](https://www.flapit.com/).
