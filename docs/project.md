# Split Flap Counter
Summary project for the Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals module

I plan to create a Youtube Subcriber Counter. The counter will use a split flap mechanism and was inspired by counters like [Smiirl](https://www.smiirl.com/en/store?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvvTDg8Ls6gIVlH0rCh0ipgDZEAAYASAAEgKEMfD_BwE) and [FlapIt](https://www.flapit.com/).

## Items Needed

- ### Flaps
		- Numbers 1 to 10, 4 digit
		- Laser Cut
		- Numbers will be placed using stickers
- ### Flaps mechanism
		- Spool
		- Tongue
		- Servo motor
- ### 3D Logo
- ### 3D Frame
- ### Wifi Module (ESP8266)
- ### Power Bank/Battery
- ### Hall effect sensor (AH1815)
- ### 5V adapter		

## Concept

The old school split flap display is cool and mesmerising to look at. Nowadays, more people are keen to start a youtube career. If you are a creative person and loves to create contents, making youtube videos may be a dream job.

I plan to create a Youtube Subcriber Counter. The counter will use a split flap mechanism that was inspired by counters like [Smiirl](https://www.smiirl.com/en/store?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvvTDg8Ls6gIVlH0rCh0ipgDZEAAYASAAEgKEMfD_BwE) and [FlapIt](https://www.flapit.com/). My split flap display will be able to count how many youtube subscribers I have and display accprdingly. It uses the stepper motor turn the spool to the desired  number. And the motor will be controlled by arduino. To help build my counter, I will be laser cutting a lot of the split flap mechanics and 3D print the house.
