# 3D Printing
In this module I learnt how to print 3D objects using Ultimaker Cura.

Step 1: Export 3D work in stl file

Step 2: Open file in Ultimaker Cura software

Step 3: Look under Prepare tab. Adjust position of unit 

Step 4: Change the suitable parameters. As a guidline it is recommended to use the following settings.
- Layer height 0.2mm
- Wall thickness 1mm
- Infill is 15%
- Top and bottom layers 2

Step 5: Press Slice and check timing.

Step 6: Save to G-Code in SD Card.

Step 7: Perform printing process of your 3D printer of choice!
