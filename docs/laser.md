# Laser Cutting

To use a laser cutter, here are some point to take note when printing.

1. Material and thickness 


2. Laser Setting
- Power 
- Speed
- PPI
- Z axis

3. Kerf
When laser cutting, some material is removed in the process. It is important to keep this in mind when sketching CAD. For instance if you want a press fit design of a box, we have to make about 0.2mm-0.3mm adjustment. If the correct adjustment is made, we can fit the pieces together perfectly without using any adhesive.

## How to save your work file

Step 1: Export in DXF. Connect to the the Computer station

Step 2: Make sure Air Assist and Exhaust fume machine is ON. This machines eliminate the smell and suck up the fumes/smoke from laser cutting.

Step 2: Check your work in CorelDraw. It is best to place profile near to each other to prevent waste. 

Step 3: Change outline colour. Red is your cutting(Hairline). Black is for engraving

Step 3: Use the correct setting depending on the material you are using.

Step 4: Adjust pointer to the correct space on the board. Check the outtermost end of your profile to make sure it fits on the board.

Step 5: Optional. Test run the work by letting the lid open. 

Step 6: Check time taken and print!
