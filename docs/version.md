# Version Control  
Version Control helps manages any changes made on my website.

I used [web-pk Jekyll Template](https://github.com/skeatz/web-pk) for the aesthetics of my web. Here are the steps on how I am able to document any changes on my site.

1. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)  
	- Create new repository
	- Publish repository
	- Make a folder EP1000 on my local pc.

2. Clone web-pk
	- Download [](https://github.com/skeatz/web-pk)
	- Select "Clone a repository from the internet"
	- New folder "web-pk" will be created

3. Copy web-pk 
	- Copy paste to new repo EP1000
	- Github Desktop > Comment changes > Commit to Master > Push origin
	- Dont forget to build from master branch!

4. Check site on the browser 

From these steps, Github Desktop will save any changes to github. Higlighted in green means I've added to the code and highlighted in red means I have deleted some codes.
