To create a webpage, one must have a basic understanding on **HTML**. And additionally **CSS** and **Javacript**. These programs can be written down on a text editor.

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. HTML is the standard language for all websites. It is mainly used to insert the content and stucture of a website.
