# Fablab Safety and Tools
## Introduction 
[Fablab SP](https://fablabs.io/labs/fablabsp) is a workshop that offers digital fabrication. In SP Campus, the fablab is equipped with 3D Printers, Laser Cutters, 3D CNC Prototype Mill, PCB Mills and Electronic Workbenches. Therefore, we need to know the [Safety Rules & Regulations](Fab%20Lab%20and%20Workshop%20Safety%20Rules%20&%20Regulations.pdf)  before using the Fablab euquipments and machinary.
