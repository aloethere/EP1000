In SP Campus, the fablab is equipped with 3D Printers, Laser Cutters, 3D CNC Prototype Mill, PCB Mills and Electronic Workbenches. Therefore, we need to know the Safety Rules & Regulations before operating the Fablab euquipments and machinary.

For protection against tool-related injuries, always wear **cut-resistant glove** and **safety goggles** when handling sharp/dangerous tools.


## Software Tools
For this module, I am using 2 main software, mainly Autodesk Fusion 360 and Sublime Text 3.

[**Fusion 360**](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)  
Fusion 360 is a Computer Aided Design Software that allows the user to design and develope any product. More info on the CAD tab.

[**Sublime Text 3**](https://www.sublimetext.com)  
My go-to text editor when documenting on my webpage. I use Sublime Text 3 to write down code in Markdown for this Webpage.

[**PicPick**](https://picpick.app/en/)
I save and editted pictures using this software. It is extremely fast and useful especuially when I needed to screenshot.
