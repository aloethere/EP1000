# Fablab Safety and Tools
## Introduction 
[Fablab SP](https://fablabs.io/labs/fablabsp) is a workshop that offers digital fabrication. In SP Campus, the fablab is equipped with 3D Printers, Laser Cutters, 3D CNC Prototype Mill, PCB Mills and Electronic Workbenches. Therefore, we need to know the Safety Rules & Regulations before operating the Fablab euquipments and machinary.

Although I had not stepped in the Fablab due to the HBL across Singapore, we are told that we will cover Safety Assesment

## Hand Tools
In Fablab, we have to get familiar with the tools available. You may check out a variety of tools and their prices here on [Horme](https://www.horme.com.sg/) or [Masterpro](https://www.masterpro.com.sg/)

*For protection against tool-related injuries, always wear cut-resistant glove and safety goggles when handling sharp/dangerous tools.*


## Software Tools
For this module, I am using 2 main software, mainly [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) and [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

**Fusion 360**
Fusion 360 is a Computer Aided Design Software that allows the user to design and develope any product. More info on the CAD tab.

**Sublime Text 3**
My go-to text editor when documenting on my webpage. I use Sublime Text 3 to write down code in Markdown for this Webpage.
