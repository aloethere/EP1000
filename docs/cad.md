# Computer Aided Design  

## GIMP
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a software that enables the user to work with different image format.  

Here is an example of how i remove a background of a fridge using GIMP.  

![Refrigerator with Background](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/refrigerated/EP1000/master/docs/images/refrigerator%20with%20background.png)  

![Refrigerator without background](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/refrigerated/EP1000/master/docs/images/refrigerator%20without%20background.png)  
GIMP has many capabilities to work with. However I prefer using my Microsoft Powerpoint to edit and save my pictures.

## Autodesk Fusion 360
It is a powerful software that allows the user to create any design model on a computer.
